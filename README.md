# My Yugioh Price Viewer
Here's my web application that allows users to search for the current average price of yugioh cards. 

**Link to project:** ygoprices.netlify.app

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

At first, this started out as a test with working with API's. It then transformed into a useable application. I worked with the API from https://ygoprodeck.com. Users can search the name of the card and the application will return the price of the card from https://www.tcgplayer.com.
